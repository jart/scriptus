All software is built standing on the shoulders of giants.

Scriptus is no exception: it is a thin sheen of code spread over the top of the [Mozilla Rhino JavaScript library](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/). In addition to Rhino, other open source libraries used include [OpenID4Java](http://code.google.com/p/openid4java/), [openid-selector](http://code.google.com/p/openid-selector/), [ACE](http://ace.ajax.org/), the [Spring framework](http://www.springframework.org/), and libraries from the [ASF](http://www.apache.org) and [Google](http://www.google.com). These components were strung together by me.

My personal thanks goes also to Torrey Searle for advice on open-sourcing the project, Sander De Dycker for the first feedback on the experience of learning and using Scriptus, [Nathanael D. Jones](http://nathanaeljones.com/) of [the Weaver project](http://weaverengine.com/) for the discussion and advice, Jean-Michel & Jenya for feedback, and Nela, Emil and Andres at Politecnico di Milano for valuable feedback and taking Scriptus in new directions.

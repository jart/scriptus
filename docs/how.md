With the release of my new side-project, the first thought some friends may have is "He has a new-born daughter! And a job! How can he neglect his family so?!". The truth is that this project was mostly done in 20-minute increments on the tram, to and from work. Occasional longer stints were done while wife and child were napping, or while "off the clock" in the office. The original proof-of-concept was done in one Eurostar trip from Brussels to London, more than a year ago.

Why have I chosen as my main 'hobby' something I also do at work? Fred Brooks put it best in his classic, "The Mythical Man-Month", in 1972:

"The sheer job of making things... the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles... the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination."

The reason I do programming outside of work is that I have a radically different set of constraints that allows me to be creative in different ways. Inside work, risk is important, procedures are important, and I have 7-8 hours a day to spend. In truth I spend more time recording my actions, communicating and cross-checking and testing, than I spend programming.

Outside work, creativity is important, risk is irrelevant, and I have 40 minutes a day max. to spend. It's the difference between painting a big mural to order, and sketching whatever you fancy in a pocket-book. This is my pocket-book doodle :-)

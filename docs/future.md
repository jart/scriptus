#The future

##Short-term

Right now, this is a kind of pet project that I've been working on in my spare time. I'd love to have feedback on the ideas of the project, and still more, if anyone would like to contribute by way of code, docs, example scripts, or anything else, those contributions would be happily and gratefully accepted.

In the short-term I have some bugs and 'good ideas' for features in `scriptus.todo`.

##Long-term

More broadly, if this project proves to have legs, then the code will evolve first and foremost in response to the needs of anyone who finds the software useful. I think there are three main directions in which I could see the code evolving.

Firstly there are extensions to the API to allow things like IPC, imports and/or HTTP calls. Secondly, people may feel Twitter is too limiting as a transport, and so we may create clients for the web, or native clients for iOS, Android, or the Facebook platform. And finally, people may prefer not to use their own standalone installation, but instead use Scriptus as a service, as many bloggers use Wordpress.com today, even though that project is also open source.

Concerning this last option, I would like to know if anyone is interested in this, so please give me your email address if you would like to be kept informed of a service like this being introduced.
